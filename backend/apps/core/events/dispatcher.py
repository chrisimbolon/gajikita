Arthasee — Core Event Bus: Dispatcher

Synchronous, in-process dispatch only, for now — deliberately, not
an oversight: requirements/base.txt has no Celery/Redis in it yet, so
there is no async transport to dispatch onto. Everything here is
still structured around the Outbox row's lifecycle (PENDING ->
PROCESSED/FAILED) specifically so that adding a real async transport
later is a change confined to this one file: a future Celery task
would just call `default_dispatcher.dispatch_now(outbox_id)` for a
PENDING Outbox row instead of this module calling it directly via
transaction.on_commit(). Nothing in bus.py, handlers.py, or any
domain app's events.py would need to change.

--- dispatch_now() added for real replay ---
This method is the real form of what the paragraph above already
promised on day one — it just didn't actually exist until a genuine
production incident needed it (5 real Outbox rows stuck FAILED on
2026-08-09, only because no AccountingPeriod existed yet). See
apps.core.events.registry for how a stored Outbox row gets
reconstructed back into a live DomainEvent, and
apps.core.management.commands.replay_failed_events for the actual
command that calls this.

        Reconstructs and re-dispatches a stored Outbox row directly —
        no live DomainEvent or handler list needs to be supplied by
        the caller, unlike _dispatch_now() below. Given just an id:

          1. Loads the real Outbox row.
          2. Reconstructs the original DomainEvent via
             apps.core.events.registry.reconstruct_event() — which
             also handles the real Decimal/UUID/date round-trip that
             a plain JSON payload loses (see that module's own
             docstring for the actual production bug this closes:
             a naive splat of the raw payload dict raised a real
             TypeError deep inside posting_engine.py on the first
             genuine replay attempt).
          3. Re-resolves the CURRENT handler list from default_bus —
             asked fresh, not cached from whenever the event was
             first published, so a handler added after the original
             failure still gets picked up on replay.
          4. Dispatches immediately via _dispatch_now(), the exact
             same code path a first-time dispatch would run —
             replay behaves identically to an original dispatch, not
             a parallel, slightly-different mechanism.

        No transaction.on_commit() involved here — there is no new
        business transaction to defer past; reconstructing a past
        event isn't itself a business action requiring that guard.

        Used by replay_failed_events (see
        apps/core/management/commands/) — the real fix for FAILED
        Outbox rows whose underlying cause has since been resolved.
