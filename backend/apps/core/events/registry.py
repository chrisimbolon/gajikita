Arthasee — Core Event Bus: Event Type Registry & Reconstruction

Maps a stored event_type string (Outbox.event_type) back to the real
DomainEvent subclass that produced it, and reconstructs a genuinely
usable, correctly-typed event instance from a stored Outbox row.

Needed for replay_failed_events (see
apps/core/management/commands/) — the command that reconstructs and
re-dispatches a FAILED Outbox row. Nothing before this ever needed
to go from a stored row BACK to a live event; dispatch always
received an already-live event object straight from the code that
just constructed it.

--- reconstruct_event() and the Decimal/UUID/date round-trip bug ---
Real production incident, found via the FIRST actual replay attempt
(2026-08-09's 5 FAILED rows): a naive `EventClass(**outbox_row.payload)`
raised `TypeError: '>' not supported between instances of 'str' and
'decimal.Decimal'` deep inside posting_engine.py — not a bug in that
file, which correctly expects real Decimal values.

The real cause: Outbox.payload is a JSONField, and JSON has no native
Decimal (or UUID, or date/datetime) type. DjangoJSONEncoder writes
each of those out as a plain string at publish time (see
apps.core.events.base's own module docstring) — and Django's
JSONField reads it back exactly that way: a str, not the original
type. A live, first-time dispatch never hits this, since it always
receives the ORIGINAL, still-real DomainEvent object, never
round-tripped through JSON. Replay is the first code path in this
whole system that ever needed to rebuild an event FROM storage, and
it's what actually exposed this gap.

reconstruct_event() fixes this generically, not by patching each
event class one at a time: it inspects the event class's own real
field types via typing.get_type_hints() (which resolves the string
annotations `from __future__ import annotations` produces back into
real type objects), and converts each payload string value back to
its real type only where the field's declared type says it should be
one of the types DjangoJSONEncoder is known to stringify. A field
genuinely meant to stay a string is never touched.

--- 2026-08-22: registry completed to cover every real event type ---
Originally shipped covering only the 4 event types that had actually
FAILED back on 2026-08-09 (PartConsumed, WorkOrderCompleted,
InvoiceIssued, PaymentReceived) — deliberately not guessed beyond
that without verifying each event class's real import path first.

A second, real production incident (2026-08-22, StockOpnameCompleted
failing on missing COA accounts 4004/5004) surfaced 4 MORE failed
event types this registry had never covered: GoodsReceived,
SupplierInvoiceReceived, SupplierPaymentMade, and StockOpnameCompleted
itself — replay_failed_events raised KeyError trying to reconstruct
them. Rather than guess at their import paths in the moment, they're
sourced from apps.accounting.posting_engine.py's own real, applied
module-level imports — the one place in this codebase that already
imports every single event type the whole system's posting engine
handles, verified rather than assumed. PurchaseReturned is included
too, for the same reason, even though it hasn't failed yet — this
registry's whole job is to never be caught short again the way it
was on both 08-09 and 08-22.

--- 1 Sep 2026: InternalCashMutationRecorded added ---
Same sourcing discipline as every entry below: confirmed against
apps.accounting.posting_engine.py's own real, applied import before
being added here, not guessed at — same as QuickPurchaseRecorded/
OperatingExpenseRecorded were on 28 Aug. Added proactively, before
this event has ever failed once, precisely because this registry's
whole job (per the 08-09/08-22 history above) is to never again be
the reason a real event type can't be replayed.
